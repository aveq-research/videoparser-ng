## General Structure

This program patches ffmpeg to add support for extracting additional bitstream properties, or codec-related information, from the bitstream. The program is structured as follows:

- `VideoParser` is an API that provides a simple interface for extracting bitstream properties from a video file. It is implemented as a basic frame-by-frame reader that itself is using ffmpeg standard API calls to read the video.
- VideoParserCli is a command-line interface for VideoParser. It is implemented by using VideoParser API calls to extract the bitstream properties, and then printing them to the console in JSON format.
- ffmpeg is cloned and has a separate branch checked out.

To pass extra information from the ffmpeg part to the VideoParser part, we use the `SharedFrameInfo` struct to store the bitstream properties like QP values, motion vectors, etc. The definition is in `VideoParser/include/shared.h`, and it is included in ffmpeg as well. The shared info is part of the `AVFrame` struct, and is extracted from there using a helper function `videoparser_get_shared_frame_info`. This is implemented in `ffmpeg/libavutil/frame.c`.

## Modifications Made

This explains the high level changes made to ffmpeg to support the extraction of bitstream properties.

We have modified `decode.c` to extract the frame index (method `ff_decode_receive_frame`).

### QP Information

To obtain the QP information, we modify:

- H.264: `h264_mb.c`, to extract the QP information from the `H264SliceContext` struct, in the function `ff_h264_hl_decode_mb`
- HEVC: `hevcdec.c`, to extract the QP information from the `HEVCLocalContext` struct, in the function `hls_coding_unit`
- VP9: `vp9.c`, to extract the QP information from the `VP9SharedContext` struct, in the function `vp9_decode_frame`
- AV1: `libaomdec.c`, to extract the QP information from the `AV1DecodeContext` struct, in the function `aom_decode`

## Testing

For testing you need `pytest`. For easy installation, just use `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which is a faster package manager for Python.

Generate the test videos:

```bash
util/generate-test-videos.sh
```

Then, obtain the test features in ldjson format:

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/aveq-storage/data/videoparser-ng/test/test.zip -O test/test.zip
unzip test/test.zip -d test
```

Now you can run the Python-based tests:

```bash
uvx pytest test/test.py
```

Also you can run the CLI tests:

```bash
uvx pytest test/test-cli.py
```

## Debugging

We have successfully used the following VS Code `launch.json` configuration to debug the CLI â€“ it requires the `CMake Tools` extension:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "(lldb) Launch",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      // Resolved by CMake Tools:
      "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
      "args": [
        // "${workspaceFolder}/test/test_video_h264.mkv",
        "${workspaceFolder}/test/test_video_h265.mkv",
      ],
      // comment out the below if you want to set your own breakpoints!
      "stopAtEntry": true,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/build",
      "environment": [
        {
          // add the directory where our target was built to the PATHs
          // it gets resolved by CMake Tools:
          "name": "PATH",
          "value": "${env:PATH}:${command:cmake.getLaunchTargetDirectory}"
        }
      ],
      "MIMode": "lldb"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace the `"${workspaceFolder}/test/test_video_h265.mkv"` with the path to the video you want to debug.

## Maintenance

### Fetching new FFmpeg commits

Occasionally you want to rebase your local FFmpeg commits on top of the latest upstream FFmpeg commits. This is done by running the dedicated script.

Run the script:

```bash
util/rebase-ffmpeg.sh
```

The rebase may not be clean, so check the output of the script and resolve any conflicts.
