## Overview

This project supplies two main components:

- A command-line tool for parsing video bitstreams (`video-parser`)
- A C++ API for parsing video bitstreams, `libvideoparser`, which is used by the CLI program

The project is aimed at providing input for bitstream-based video (quality) assessment.

Internally, ffmpeg is used, and linked into the project. Currently, the project is built with ffmpeg `959b799c8d7` (January 2025) based on the `master` branch. We strive to keep the project up to date with the latest ffmpeg version.
The actual ffmpeg changes are published in [this `ffmpeg` fork](https://github.com/aveq-research/ffmpeg/tree/videoparser) in the `videoparser` branch.

## History and Goals

The project is using previous work from the [`bitstream_mode3_videoparser`](https://github.com/Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment/bitstream_mode3_videoparser) project, but written from the ground up to be faster.

The overall goal is to provide bitstream statistics to be later used for calculating video quality metrics such as ITU-T Rec. P.1204.3, which has a [reference implementation available](https://github.com/Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment/bitstream_mode3_p1204_3).

There are some design docs about this project [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pnQGDWRjSfff4TyTNWcdeUmCMdCz8crsGo6Ws3rR6W0/edit?tab=t.0). It explains the rationale for the creation of the project, the detailed statistics available in the `bitstream_mode3_videoparser` project we'd like to port over, and what we would like to add as features on top of that.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 or higher, or macOS 12.0 or higher
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- A C++17 compiler (GCC 9.3 or higher, Clang 10.0 or higher)

You also need:

- `pkg-config`
- `ninja-build`

Note that you can skip the build step by just using the pre-built Docker image.

### Installation under macOS

Xcode is required to compile software on your Mac. Install Xcode by ​downloading it from the website or using the Mac App Store.

After installing Xcode, install the Command Line Tools from Preferences > Downloads > Components. You can also install the tools via your shell:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), install the required packages:

```bash
brew install \
  cmake ninja pkg-config \
  automake git libtool sdl shtool texi2html wget nasm \
  aom
```

### Installation under Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install \
  autoconf \
  automake \
  build-essential \
  cmake \
  git-core \
  libsdl2-dev \
  libtool \
  libunistring-dev \
  meson \
  ninja-build \
  pkg-config \
  texinfo \
  wget \
  yasm \
  nasm \
  zlib1g-dev \
  libbz2-dev \
  libaom-dev
```

## Build

First clone all submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then build ffmpeg initially:

```bash
util/build-ffmpeg.sh
```

Then run the build script for the project:

```bash
util/build-cmake.sh
```

This will create the library: `build/VideoParser/libvideoparser.a`

You can also run the CLI:

```
build/VideoParserCli/video-parser
```

### Rebuilding ffmpeg

If you get a warning like:

```
WARNING: libavcodec/allcodecs.c newer than config_components.h, rerun configure
```

Then run:

```bash
util/build-ffmpeg.sh --reconfigure
```

This will rebuild ffmpeg after which you can run the build script for the project again.

## Docker

### Pre-built Docker image

We provide a pre-built Docker image on GitHub Container Registry. You can use it without building it yourself.

To pull the image, you need to have a valid GitHub token with access to the repository. If you don't have a token, [create one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and make sure it has `read:packages` scope enabled.

```bash
docker login ghcr.io
```

You will be prompted to enter your GitHub username, and as password, enter your personal access token. Once you have a token, you can pull the image, and rename it to `videoparser-ng` for easier use.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/aveq-research/videoparser-ng:master
docker image tag ghcr.io/aveq-research/videoparser-ng:master videoparser-ng
```

### Building the Docker image yourself

To build the project with Docker, run:

```bash
docker build -t videoparser-ng .
```

This will build the project and create a Docker image named `videoparser-ng`.

## Usage

To run the CLI, run:

```bash
build/VideoParserCli/video-parser <path-to-video-file>
```

Or, for Docker, you must mount the video file into the container, e.g. to run it on `test/test_video_h264.mkv`, do:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/test/test_video_h264.mkv:/video.mkv videoparser-ng /video.mkv
```

Add the option `-h` for detailed usage.

## Output

The tool will print a set of line-delimited JSON records to STDOUT, either for per-sequence statistics, or per-frame statistics. These are denoted with the `type` field.

Example, but formatted with `jq` to make it more readable:

```bash
build/VideoParserCli/video-parser test/test_video_h264.mkv -n 1 | jq
```

This would print:

```json
{
  "type": "sequence_info",
  "video_bit_depth": 8,
  "video_bitrate": 0.0,
  "video_codec": "h264",
  "video_codec_level": 52,
  "video_codec_profile": 100,
  "video_duration": 10.0,
  "video_frame_count": 0,
  "video_framerate": 60.0,
  "video_height": 2160,
  "video_pix_fmt": "yuv420p",
  "video_width": 3840
}
{
  "dts": 0.0,
  "frame_idx": 0,
  "frame_type": 1,
  "is_idr": true,
  "pts": 0.0,
  "qp_avg": 25.0,
  "qp_bb_avg": 25.0,
  "qp_bb_stdev": 7.54983443527075,
  "qp_init": 19,
  "qp_max": 42,
  "qp_min": 15,
  "qp_stdev": 7.54983443527075,
  "size": 19261,
  "type": "frame_info"
}
```

The tool will also print various logs to STDERR which you can redirect to a file if you want to save them, or ignore with `2>/dev/null`.

## Available Metrics

The following metadata/metrics are available:

- Per-sequence (type: `sequence_info`):
  - Video codec
  - Video codec profile
  - Video codec level
  - Video width
  - Video height
  - Video pixel format
  - Video bit depth
  - Video frame rate
  - Video duration
  - Video frame count
  - Video bitrate
- Per-frame data (type: `frame_info`):
  - Frame type
  - Frame size
  - Frame PTS
  - Frame DTS
  - Frame index
  - Frame is IDR
  - Other, specific per-frame metrics are being implemented at the moment, see [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md) for more details.
